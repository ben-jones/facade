\section{Conclusion}

This project has been a good experience in developing anti-censorship tools. HTPT is not complete enough to be used in an area where censorship is a way of life, but it is a good prototype for further work. 

As such, this can be easily expanded upon. The decision to make the encoding schemes easily extensible is important, as it allows for other developers to implement more creative or less frequently used HTTP elements to further mask a stream. HTPT could be turned into a proper Tor Pluggable Transport such that it could be used by a much larger audience.

Additionally, HTPT can be used alone, or in conjunction with an encrypted protocol stream, such as Tor or an SSH tunnel. By providing a scheme that can be used without relying on another protocol, HTPT is valuable alone.
