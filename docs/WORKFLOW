Workflow
========

1) Fork the repo and clone it locally
 $ git clone https://github.com/<user-name>/htpt.git

2) Add the remote to the original repo
 $ git remote add gsathya https://github.com/gsathya/htpt.git

3) Create a new branch
 $ git checkout -b bugxxx

4) Make some changes
 $ emacs htptxx.py
 
5) Stage the changed files
 $ git add <changed-files>

6) Pull in changes that might have happened while you were developing;
   if there any conflicts, fix them
 $ git pull --rebase gsathya master

7) Commit your changes
 $ git commit
  
8) Push your changes to your repo
 $ git push origin bugxxx

9) Create a pull request on github, once the pull request is merged, go
   back to your master branch
 $ git checkout master

10) Pull in the recent changes
 $ git pull --rebase gsathya master

11) Repeat step 3

12) ???

13) PROFIT.

Notes
=====

* Your master branch must always be the upto date with the canonical
  master(gsathya/master) -- it should not be ahead or behind.

* Name your branches with some context -- bugxxx is fine
